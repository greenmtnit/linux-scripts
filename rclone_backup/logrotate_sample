# Sample logrotate config
# Put this in /etc/logrotate.d 
# Make sure owner is root and permissions are 644

# First goes the path to the log file to rotate
/var/log/rclone_backup.log {
  # rotate logs weekly
  weekly
  
  # keep 5 most recent logs
  rotate 5 
  
  # rotate log files if they grow larger than to 10K
  size 1M
  
  # add a datestamp to the rotate logs in the format YYYYMMDD
  dateext
  
  # create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
  create
  
  # uncomment this if you want log files compressed
  compress
  
  # Truncate the original log file to zero size in place,
  # instead of moving the old file and creating a new one.
  # Helps with programs that expect the log file to always be there.
  copytruncate
